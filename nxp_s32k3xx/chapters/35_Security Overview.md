Security Overview
35.1 Introduction
This chip has a comprehensive set of customer-configurable security features designed to protect code and data from 
unauthorized access. The content of this section is for non-secure operation only. Contact your NXP representative for details if 
you need secure operation.
35.2 Security features
S32K3xx:
• Exceeds the EVITA- full [7] functionality and offers high performance for edge nodes applications.
• Bases its chip censorship on the life cycle model. Access to chip code and data becomes progressively more restricted as 
the chip matures through a defined set of life cycle steps.
• Offers these memory security features:
— NVM censorship support
— Debug password protection
— OTP flash memory areas
• Supports a unique ID—The chip has a unique ID stored in an OTP flash memory area. Any core on the chip can read this 
unique ID.
• Includes HSE_B, which is a dedicated security system providing:
— A processor core
— Dedicated SRAM
— Symmetric Hardware Accelerator
— Asymmetric Hardware Accelerator
— True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
— Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)
— Exclusive access to secure areas of the chip's flash memory
— OTA : In Field Secure Code/Data updates
 
Refer Security Reference Manual and Firmware Reference Manual for the details on OTA.
  NOTE  
Also, HSE_B runs NXP firmware independently from the main chip processor cores and can implement advanced security 
and monitoring functions.
• Supports a secure debugger interface.
• Provides boot modes:
[7] EVITA was a European research project existing from 2008 to 2011. There is no standard or a specification to test 
compliancy. However, HSE_B meets the common expectations often described in the industry as EVITA Full and exceeds 
them in these cases:
— HSE_B supports up to AES-256 instead of AES-128
— HSE_B supports up to ECC-521 instead of ECC-256
— HSE_B supports SHA-2/Miyaguchi-Preneel instead of Whirlpool

— Trusted and secure boot support
— Handshake that supports BAF
• Monitors operating conditions to maximize tampering resistance.
• Includes basic debugger restrictions (on and off via censorship mode).
AES_ACCEL
Includes AES_ACCEL, which provides an independent DMA-controlled crypto accelerator with security features. AES_ACCEL 
provides timeout counters. The user can transfer keys from HSE_B to the AES_ACCEL keystore, which can hold 80 keys. [8]
 
See AES_ACCEL Subsystem Reference Manual for details.
  NOTE  
When HSE_B detects a security failure, it moves the chip to a secure state. The chip secure states comply with the chip safe states. 
You enter a safe state as reset when there are security errors leading to reset. Moreover, if the chip stays in Run mode and the 
lifecycle moves to the IN_FIELD phase in reaction to errors, the safety application can continue running without glitches.
